# 🐍 100 Days of Python – Day 6

## Topic: Functions and While Loops

## What I Learned Today

### Functions
Learned about functions in Python and how they help in:
- Reusing code
- Improving readability
- Breaking problems into smaller, manageable parts

Understood how functions make programs more structured and easier to maintain.

### While Loops
Learned about `while` loops and how they repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.

Practiced `while` loops using **Reeborg's World**, which helped in understanding:
- Loop conditions
- Repeating actions until a goal is achieved
- Avoiding infinite loops

### Reeborg's World Practice
Solved the following challenges using functions and while loops:
- Hurdle 1
- Hurdle 2
- Hurdle 3
- Hurdle 4
- Maze problem

These problems improved my logical thinking and helped me understand how loops and functions work together in real scenarios.

## Key Takeaways
- Functions help write clean and reusable code
- While loops are useful when the number of iterations is not known
- Combining functions with loops simplifies complex problems
- Practice through problem-solving improves confidence

## Progress
