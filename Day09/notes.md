# 🐍 100 Days of Python – Day 9

## Topic: Dictionaries and Nesting

## What I Learned Today

### Dictionaries in Python
Learned about **dictionaries**, which store data in **key–value pairs**.

Key points understood:
- Each key maps to a value
- Keys are unique
- Values can be of any data type
- Dictionaries help organize and access data efficiently

Dictionaries are very useful when data needs to be stored with meaningful labels instead of index numbers.

---

### Accessing and Updating Dictionaries
Learned how to:
- Access values using keys
- Add new key–value pairs
- Update existing values
- Remove items from a dictionary

This helped in understanding how dictionaries are dynamic and mutable.

---

### Nesting in Dictionaries
Learned about **nesting**, which means:
- A dictionary inside another dictionary
- A list inside a dictionary
- A dictionary inside a list

Nesting allows storing **complex and structured data**, similar to real-world data representation.

---

### Why Dictionaries Are Important
- They make data more readable
- They are faster for lookups compared to lists
- They are widely used in real-world applications like configurations, JSON data, and APIs

## Key Takeaways
- Dictionaries store data using key–value pairs
- Nesting helps represent complex data structures
- Choosing the right data structure improves code clarity
- Dictionaries are essential for scalable programs
