# 🐍 100 Days of Python – Day 5

## Topic: Loops

## What I Learned Today

### for Loops
Learned how to use for loops to iterate over sequences like lists and ranges.
Loops help avoid repetitive code and make programs efficient.

Key points:
- Iterating through lists
- Iterating through ranges
- Using loop variables correctly

### Problem Solving Using Loops
Solved problems using loops such as:
- Finding the sum of numbers in a list
- Finding the maximum number in a list
- Applying conditions inside loops

These exercises improved my logical thinking and looping patterns.

### FizzBuzz Problem
Worked on the FizzBuzz problem to practice:
- Looping through a range of numbers
- Using conditional statements
- Using the modulo operator

### Mini Project – Password Generator
Built a Password Generator project using loops, conditional logic, randomization, strings, and lists.
The project focused on generating secure passwords based on defined rules.

## Key Takeaways
- Loops are essential for repetitive tasks
- Combining loops with conditions builds strong logic
- Practice improves problem-solving skills
