# 🐍 100 Days of Python – Day 7

## Topic: Project Day – Hangman Game

## What I Did Today

### Project: Hangman
Today was a **project-based learning day** where I built the **Hangman game** using all the Python concepts learned so far.

This project helped me revise and apply multiple fundamentals together in one real program.

### Concepts Used in the Project
- Variables
- Data types
- Lists
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
- Loops (`for` and `while`)
- Functions
- Logical operators
- Randomization
- String manipulation

### What I Learned from This Project
- How different Python concepts work together in a single project
- How to break a large problem into smaller logical steps
- How loops and conditions control game flow
- The importance of clean logic and structure in programs

### Challenges Faced
- Managing game state correctly
- Handling user input
- Controlling the loop until the game ends

Solving these challenges improved my problem-solving skills and confidence.

## Key Takeaways
- Projects help solidify concepts much better than isolated practice
- Combining multiple fundamentals builds real programming skills
- Writing logic step by step makes complex problems manageable

## Progress
Day 7 / 100 completed
