🐍 100 Days of Python – Day 3
📌 Topic: Conditional Statements
📚 What I Learned Today
1️⃣ if and else Statements

Learned how Python makes decisions using if and else.

age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote")

2️⃣ Different Conditional Statements

Used multiple conditions with if, elif, and else.

score = 85

if score >= 90:
    print("Grade A")
elif score >= 75:
    print("Grade B")
else:
    print("Grade C")

3️⃣ Modulo Operator (%)

Learned about the modulo operator and why it is used.

% returns the remainder after division

Commonly used to check even/odd numbers

number = 10

if number % 2 == 0:
    print("Even number")
else:
    print("Odd number")

4️⃣ Nested if-else

Learned how to place one if-else inside another.

age = 20
has_id = True

if age >= 18:
    if has_id:
        print("Entry allowed")
    else:
        print("ID required")
else:
    print("Age restriction")

5️⃣ Logical Operators

Learned logical operators used to combine conditions:

and → both conditions must be true

or → at least one condition must be true

not → reverses the condition

age = 25
has_license = True

if age >= 18 and has_license:
    print("You can drive")
else:
    print("You cannot drive")

🚀 Mini Project – Day 3

Built a small project using:

if-else conditions

Modulo operator

Nested conditions

Logical operators

The project focused on decision making based on user input.
